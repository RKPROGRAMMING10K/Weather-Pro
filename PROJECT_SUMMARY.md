## 🚀 How to Run

### Prerequisites
- Node.js >= 18
- React Native development environment
- **Android Studio with Android SDK** (for Android development)
- Xcode (for iOS development - macOS only)

### ⚠️ Android Setup Required
Before running on Android, you need to configure the Android SDK:

1. **Install Android Studio** if not already installed
2. **Find your Android SDK location** in Android Studio settings
3. **Set SDK path** in `android/local.properties`:
   ```
   sdk.dir=C:/Users/YourUsername/AppData/Local/Android/Sdk
   ```
   **Note: Use forward slashes (/) not backslashes (\)**
4. **Or set ANDROID_HOME environment variable**

📋 **See [ANDROID_SETUP.md](./ANDROID_SETUP.md) for detailed troubleshooting guide**

### ✅ SOLUTION VERIFIED: 
The app successfully builds and installs when the SDK path is correctly set with forward slashes in `local.properties`.

### Running the App

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start Metro bundler:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. **Run on Android:** ✅ **VERIFIED WORKING**
   ```bash
   npm run android
   ```
   *Note: Make sure Android emulator is running or device is connected*
   
   **Alternative (if npm command fails):**
   ```bash
   cd android && gradlew installDebug
   ```

4. **Run on iOS:**
   ```bash
   npm run ios
   ```
   *Note: macOS and Xcode required*

5. **Run tests:**
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

## 🌐 API Integration Ready

The app is prepared for OpenWeatherMap API integration:
- Service layer ready for real API calls
- Mock data for development and testing
- Environment variable setup for API keys
- Error handling for API failures

**To enable real API:**
1. Get API key from OpenWeatherMap
2. Add to `.env` file
3. Uncomment real API code in `WeatherService`

## 📱 Current Features

### Home Screen
- ✅ Clean, modern UI with Material Design
- ✅ Search bar with validation and debouncing
- ✅ Current weather card with detailed metrics
- ✅ 5-day forecast display
- ✅ Pull-to-refresh functionality
- ✅ Loading and error states
- ✅ Offline data loading

### Settings Screen
- ✅ Temperature unit selection
- ✅ Theme selection (Light/Dark/Auto)
- ✅ App information
- ✅ Settings persistence

## 🔮 Next Steps

1. **Add real API integration** - Uncomment API code and add API key
2. **Add location services** - GPS-based weather detection
3. **Add weather maps** - Interactive weather maps
4. **Add notifications** - Weather alerts and updates
5. **Add widgets** - Home screen weather widgets

## 🎉 Summary
